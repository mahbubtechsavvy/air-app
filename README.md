Air 30X: Real-Time Air Quality and Health Guidance üåç
Air 30X is a Streamlit-based app that delivers real-time air quality and weather insights for cities like Dhaka, empowering users to protect their health and combat climate change. Using APIs like IQAir, OpenWeatherMap, and Mapbox, it provides AQI, health recommendations, historical air quality graphs, and more. A voice call AI agent (powered by ElevenLabs) offers instant medical advice, such as ‚Äúdrink 2‚Äì3 liters of fresh water daily,‚Äù helping users tackle pollution‚Äôs 7 million annual deaths (WHO, 2021). Air 30X supports all 17 SDGs and aims to reach 2.5 billion people in polluted regions by 2030 (UNEP, 2024).
Features

Real-Time Data: AQI, health recommendations, historical air quality graphs, most polluted locations near cities like Dhaka, today‚Äôs weather, 7-day weather and AQI forecasts, top 10 most polluted cities globally, and a world air pollution map.
Voice AI Guidance: Instant medical advice via a voice call AI agent, e.g., ‚Äúlimit outdoor time to 30 minutes at AQI >150.‚Äù
SDG Impact: Reduces 13% of pollution-linked asthma cases (Anenberg et al., 2018) while supporting global sustainability goals.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy navigation and data visualization.
